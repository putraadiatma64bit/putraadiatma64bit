# Hi, I’m **Putra Adiatma** 👋  

## 🧭 About Me  

I help businesses **solve operational and scalability problems** by designing and building **reliable information systems**.  

My focus is not on using many technologies, but on **choosing the right architecture and implementation** so systems are:
- usable in real operations  
- scalable as the business grows  
- maintainable in the long term  

I work end-to-end: **understanding business processes → translating them into system logic → delivering working software**.

---

## 🎯 What I Do  

- Transform **manual or fragmented business processes** into integrated digital systems  
- Design **transaction-critical systems** (billing, payments, sales, inventory)  
- Build **real-time and high-concurrency applications** for growing businesses  
- Reduce development and operational friction through **automation and system standardization**

> Programming languages and frameworks are tools — **business outcomes are the goal**.
